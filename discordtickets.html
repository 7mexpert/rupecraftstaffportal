    <h2>Discord Tickets</h2>
    <p>‎ </p>
    <p>Helping players encompasses both responding to player inquiries in-game and on Discord, as well as </p>
    <p>responding to tickets on Discord. As a moderator, you are expected to fulfil both roles.</p>
    <p>‎ </p>
    <p>Tickets are shown on the “Support” tab of your Discord client.</p>
    <p>‎ </p>
    <p>When responding to a ticket, you should not press the “Claim” button unless it is an administrative</p>
    <p>ticket and you have admin privileges. Many tickets will be simple, like “Is X allowed on the server?”,</p>
    <p>or “How do I do X on this server?”. These are simple questions that can be answered quickly. Give a </p>
    <p>concise answer that clearly answers the question, and then request to close the ticket by typing </p>
    <p>“/closerequest”. If the person feels you haven’t sufficiently answered their question, they will deny </p>
    <p>the close request. </p>
    <p>‎ </p>
    <p>Tickets like suggestions or bug reports are administrative, and should be handled by an admin. </p>
    <p>‎ </p>
    <p>If they are trolling by denying requests instead of denying for an actual reason, you should alert an </p>
    <p>admin in order for them to force-close the ticket. If you are not an admin, you should never force-close </p>
    <p>a ticket yourself. </p>
    <p>‎ </p>
    <p>If another person has answered or is answering a ticket, do not attempt to answer the ticket as well. </p>
