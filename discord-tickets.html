                Helping players encompasses both responding to player inquiries in-game and on Discord, as well as responding to tickets on Discord. As a moderator, you are expected to fulfil both roles.<br><br>
                First, we will cover responding to Discord tickets.<br><br>
                Tickets are shown on the “Support” tab of your Discord client, and will appear something like this:<br><br>
                When responding to a ticket, you should not press the “Claim” button unless it is an administrative ticket and you have admin privileges. Many tickets will be simple, like “Is X allowed on the server?”, or “How do I do X on this server?”. These are simple questions that can be answered quickly. Give a concise answer that clearly answers the question, and then request to close the ticket by typing “/closerequest”. If the person feels you haven't sufficiently answered their question, they will deny the close request.<br><br>
                Tickets like suggestions or bug reports are administrative, and should be handled by an admin.<br><br>
                If they are trolling by denying requests instead of denying for an actual reason, you should alert an admin in order for them to force-close the ticket. If you are not an admin, you should never force-close a ticket yourself.<br><br>
                If another person has answered or is answering a ticket, do not attempt to answer the ticket as well.<br><br>
