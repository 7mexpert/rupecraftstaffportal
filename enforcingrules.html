    <h2>Enforcing Rules</h2>
    <p>‎ </p>
    <p>All Rules and Punishments can be found at RupeCraft.com/rules or by doing /rules in-game.</p>
    <p>The following punishments can be applied to players, and should be done so through the following:</p>
    <p>‎ </p>
    <p>Warning a player should be done through the /warn command on both the discord and Minecraft server,</p> 
    <p>muting should be done using the /mute [reason] command. Temp-banning should be done by using the /tempban</p>
    <p>[time] [reason] command, and season or perm banning should be done using the /ban [reason] command. In the</p>
    <p>reason, it should specify whether or not it was a season-ban or a perm-ban. It should be done by saying</p> 
    <p>something like “[rule-breaker] was season-banned for [reason]”.</p>
    <p>‎ </p>
    <p>You may receive player reports. You should inform the reporter that you are monitoring the offending user and</p>
    <p>should, when they are online, use your moderator tools, look at their behaviour to see if they are likely breaking</p>
    <p>the rules.</p>
